It's more-or-less a Rust rewrite of Nuspell, which itself is more-or-less a rewrite of Hunspell. Spellbook has a pretty slim interface: you can instantiate a dictionary from Hunspell dictionary files and use it to check words. For a small example of how you might use Spellbook:\n\nIn this post we'll be looking at the string representation used in Spellbook and aiming to optimize it to save memory.\nStrings in Spellbook\nHow Spellbook works exactly is beyond the scope of this post, so this section gives a simplified overview and deals with simplified types. If you're interested in more details, check out the Spellbook README or @zverok's Rebuilding the Spellchecker blog post and the Spellbook internals document.\nA central part of the procedure to check a word is to look up word(s) in a hash table. This lookup table contains an entry for each \"stem\" in the dictionary. You might imagine that the Dictionary type is a wrapper around a HashSet&lt;String&gt;. This is correct in essence but Hunspell-like checkers don't store every possible word in memory. Instead there is some \"compression.\" For an example from the en_US (American English) dictionary, the lookup table in Spellbook associates a stem \"adventure\" with a set of flags like 'D', 'R' and 'S'. The flags correspond to rules defined for the dictionary allowing transformations like prefixes and suffixes. 'D' for example allows adding the \"d\" (or \"ed\" or \"ied\", depending on the stem) suffix, producing \"adventured.\" 'R' allows \"adventurer\" and 'S' allows \"adventures.\" So we can imagine that the lookup table has a type similar to HashMap&lt;String, HashSet&lt;Flag&gt;&gt;.\nDespite the \"compression\" that prefixes and suffixes enable, the lookup table contains many entries. The exact number varies with which dictionary files you use as input but American English contains around 50,000 stems, and it's a relatively slim dictionary. Others contain hundreds of thousands or even millions of stems, so it's worth trying to optimize the space we take for each stem.\nGood optimizations come from good observations so let's list out some properties of these strings:\n\nOnce inserted into the lookup table these strings are never modified.\nThese strings have a small maximum size. Spellbook refuses to check words over 360 bytes long (in UTF-8 representation) so there's no point in storing words over 360 bytes in the lookup table.\nStems correspond to words so they're typically shorter rather than longer.\n\nStrings in Rust\nLet's take a bit of a detour to talk about how strings are represented in Rust. For starters there's the String type. Strings are quite flexible: they can be modified, resized and have a large maximum size. As for how they are represented, the Rust docs say:\n\nA String is made up of three components: a pointer to some bytes, a length, and a capacity.\n\nSimplifying a bit here, we can imagine a String looks like this:\n\nBox&lt;str&gt; and fat pointers\nThe first thing that comes to mind is that storing length and capacity is redundant for our use-case. In our lookup table the strings are never modified so there's no need to store any extra information that would allow us to resize the string. A non-resizable string can be written with the Box&lt;str&gt; type. Box&lt;str&gt; is the owned version of a &amp;str.\n&amp;str and slices (&amp;[T]) have an interesting representation and learning about them is a good way to dig into \"fat pointers\" in Rust. A &amp;str (or equivalently, &amp;[u8]) is a fat pointer - a pointer to some bytes plus some metadata. For &amp;[T] the metadata is the length of the slice. Using a fat pointer makes string (&amp;str) and other slices nice to work with - you can subslice and read the length of a string slice cheaply and ergonomically. Box&lt;str&gt; and Box&lt;[T]&gt; are laid out the same way.\nYou can imagine that these fat pointers are basically a tuple (*const T, usize). This takes 2 usizes worth of memory to represent: one usize for the actual pointer (\"thin pointer\") and one for the metadata. What exactly is a usize though? Quoting the Rust docs again:\n\nThe size of [usize] is how many bytes it takes to reference any location in memory. For example, on a 32 bit target, this is 4 bytes and on a 64 bit target, this is 8 bytes.\n\nSo usize is an unsigned integer type of the same size as a \"thin pointer\": a pointer with no metadata, like *const T/*mut T or equivalently NonNull&lt;T&gt;. For simplicity we'll talk only about 64 bit targets for the rest of the post and assume that size_of::&lt;usize&gt;() == 8.\nBy switching the stem type to Box&lt;str&gt; we save 8 bytes per stem from not tracking capacity, taking advantage of our observation that strings are not modified. Nice! But there's still room for improvement from our other observations.\nThe road to \"German strings\"\nThe other observations are about the length of each string. They're short. If the length field is a usize that means your strings can be at most 2^64 bytes long, and wow that is long! Our strings will never be longer than 360 bytes so of the 64 bits we use to represent the length we'll only ever use 9 (2^9 = 512). That's quite a few bits wasted. If we used a u16 to store the length instead we'd save 6 bytes. What should we do with those 6 bytes we've saved?\nThis is where \"German strings\" come in. \"German strings\" or \"German-style strings\" or \"Umbra strings\" (all the same thing) are described very well in a post from CedarDB: Why German Strings are Everywhere. The idea is to use a integer type smaller than usize for the length (u32 in their case) and repurpose the remaining bytes to store a prefix of the data. We can store a few more bytes in the \"prefix\" section since we're using a u16 for length, so our type would look like this in memory:\n\n\nUmbra and CedarDB like this prefix because it can be used to cheaply compute whether two of these UmbraStrings are (not) equal - the Eq trait in Rust.\nConsider a very short string like \"hi!\". In memory that would look like so:\n\nAnd what's the pointer pointing to? Nothing I guess. We already stored the full string right in the struct \"inline.\" So there's no need to allocate memory and point to it.\nIn fact for medium-long strings that can fit in the prefix bytes plus the pointer bytes, we can eliminate the pointer part altogether. This is a Short String Optimization (SSO): when the string is short enough, we can store it directly in our UmbraString struct and avoid allocating a buffer. We can store 6 bytes in the prefix and another 8 in the suffix area for a total of 14 bytes inline. For an ASCII string, that's up to 14 characters we can represent without allocating. Very nice!\n\nThis either-or type would look like so, using a union:\n\nHow do we know which member of the union our UmbraString is? Just look at the len field: if it's 14 or less then we're using the \"short\" variant - everything inline. If it's 15 or greater then the string is allocated and pointed to.\nMemory savings\nWhy is this layout so attractive?\nThis representation is no more expensive than a Box&lt;str&gt; in terms of memory consumption. size_of::&lt;Box&lt;str&gt;&gt;() is 16 - 16 bytes. (Note that size_of is counting the size of the type, not the size of the allocation the pointer is pointing to.) size_of::&lt;UmbraString&gt;() is also 16. The difference is that any non-empty Box&lt;str&gt; will allocate. A short string like \"hi!\" allocates 3 bytes somewhere on the heap for a total of 19 bytes. UmbraString does not: it's still 16 bytes. For a medium string like \"hello_world!\" Box&lt;str&gt; will allocate those 12 bytes on the heap for a total cost of 28 bytes. The equivalent UmbraString is still a total of 16 bytes. For long strings like \"a\".repeat(50), Box&lt;str&gt; will allocate the 50 bytes for a total cost of 66 bytes. In the worst case (long strings) UmbraString is no worse: it also takes exactly 66 bytes.\nUmbra strings are attractive here because they don't have a memory cost: we would be paying the 16 bytes of a Box&lt;str&gt; anyways and wasting the 6 bytes from the length usize. Any time we use the inline variant of UmbraString we save memory.\nYou might also think UmbraString is faster to work with if you commonly have short strings because you don't need to follow a pointer to compare data. We'll see in the benchmarks that UmbraString is not much different in terms of speed. We need an extra comparison operation to figure out if we're using a short or long variant after all.\nTheory into practice: let's build UmbraString\nThis is basically the same snippet as above. We'll define some constants for the lengths of each segment and some basic helpers.\n\nDefault\nThe empty string is easy to represent: the length is 0 so it belongs as the inline variant. We'll set everything to zero - we won't access those bytes so it doesn't really matter what they're set to, but this seems like a reasonable default.\n\nAllocating\nLet's define some helper functions for actually allocating the data. The allocation helpers are only used when working with the long variant. A &amp;str is a &amp;[u8] that is valid UTF-8 so we'll be working in terms of *mut u8/*const u8 thin pointers.\n\ncopy_slice allocates an array of bytes on the heap and then copies the source byte slice into our new array, and returns the pointer.\nInstantiation\nTo create an UmbraString we'll take an existing &amp;str as input. This operation could possibly fail if the input string is too long. Let's ignore that for now and just assert! that the string is not too long:\n\nFor the short variant (src.len() as u16 &lt;= INLINE_LEN) we copy from the source byte slice into however much of the prefix and suffix slices we can fill and leave the rest as 0s. (Note that 0 is a valid representation in UTF-8. See the section below on FlagSets for more discussion on why this is important.)\nFor the long variant we'll use our copy_slice helper from above to allocate a new byte array pointer.\nReconstructing a byte slice\nDid you notice in our copy_slice helper function above that we copy the entire slice into a newly allocated array buffer instead of the part after the prefix? We copied source instead of &amp;source[PREFIX_LEN..]. You might think that we could save some space by only storing the remaining bytes after the prefix - and we could - but that would prevent us from recreating a &amp;[u8] or &amp;str from an UmbraString. Slices are contiguous memory chunks - array layouts in memory. We can't create a slice that starts in the prefix field and then continues by following a pointer. All of the data needs to be in one place.\nWith that in mind, let's add a function to get our bytes back:\n\nFor inline Umbra strings our slice starts at the prefix field and ends either in the prefix field's array or in the suffix field's array depending on the length. The #[repr(C)] annotation on UmbraString and Trailing enforces that when represented in memory at runtime, the fields are in the same order as we define them, so we can safely assume that prefix comes before suffix and there's no space between. We can safely treat them as contiguous memory. For allocated strings we reconstruct the slice directly from our allocated buffer's pointer.\nRemember earlier when we said that slices were basically (*const T, usize)? That's what we give to slice::from_raw_parts - a pointer to an array layout in memory and a length - and we get a fat pointer.\nClone\nCloning the string is similar to how we initially created one from a &amp;str.\n\nThe len and prefix fields are copied. For the inline version we copy the suffix array too, and for the allocated version we create a new allocation and copy self's buffer.\nAnother nice property of this type you might notice here: for strings short enough to be inlined, Clone is actually a Copy - no allocation required.\nDrop\nNow on to Drop. We need to deallocate our allocated buffer for the long variant. For the short variant we do nothing: Copy types are cleaned up without any mention in Drop.\n\nEq\nAs the CedarDB article notes, we can optimize the comparison of Umbra strings. To do that we cast the len and prefix chunks together as a usize and compare those, and then compare the remaining parts of the string if that first word of memory is equal. We don't use the Eq optimization in Spellbook since Umbra strings are only used for the lookup table representation (we use PartialEq&lt;str&gt; for UmbraString instead), but it's interesting from an academic perspective.\n\nWe start by comparing the length and prefix parts together with one usize comparison. If that is equal then we need to check the rest. For the short variant we can use another usize comparison to check the rest. For the long variant we can reconstruct the byte slices for the remaining bytes and compare those.\nWe can actually make this a little better. We know in that else block that the lengths of self and other are equal but comparing the byte slices (PartialEq&lt;Self&gt; for &amp;[T]) will repeat that check. We can skip that check and do the comparison directly. Since u8s are byte-wise equal to each other, we can use memcmp like the standard library does.\n\nBenchmarking and memory analysis\nSpeed benchmarks are unfortunately not very interesting. Spellbook doesn't take advantage of the Eq comparison so we only end up paying for the conversion in UmbraString::as_slice. This is nearly imperceptibly slower than Box&lt;str&gt;::as_bytes. Using cargo bench and simple benchmarks like so:\n\numbra_str_as_bytes measures at around 0.69 ns/iter on my machine while boxed_str_as_bytes measures around 0.46 ns/iter. We would need to be converting to bytes very very often to notice the difference, and Spellbook doesn't ultimately convert that often. The benchmarks for Spellbook's check function don't change perceptibly.\nWhere we see the difference is in memory usage and heap interaction. Measuring heap allocations is not as straightforward in Rust as you might imagine if you're coming from garbage collected languages: garbage collectors need to track the heap to know when to clean up garbage so there's typically an interface to query heap information. Not so with Rust. Measuring Memory Usage in Rust from the rust-analyzer blog points out a few options. Of them I'm partial to valgrind's DHAT tool since it's straightforward to use.\nWe'll run a small example program that creates the en_US dictionary and checks a single word:\n\nBefore (Box&lt;str&gt; stems), DHAT reports:\n\nAfter (UmbraString stems):\n\nWe've saved around 300kb of total runtime memory (12%) with the change, plus we're using fewer blocks of memory and reading from and writing to the heap less. Success!\nWe can go further though if we apply this \"German string\" optimization to another oft-instantiated type in the lookup table: the FlagSet.\nBonus points: the FlagSet can also be German!\nRemember way back at the beginning of the post when were discussing the lookup table and how it's like a HashMap&lt;String, HashSet&lt;Flag&gt;&gt;? The HashSet&lt;Flag&gt; part is defined in the Spellbook source as a FlagSet newtype wrapper. It doesn't wrap a HashSet&lt;Flag&gt; though - hash sets can be wasteful in terms of memory usage. Before the Umbra string optimization they were represented as Box&lt;[Flag]&gt;. For short slices, slice::contains or slice::binary_search are very fast at determining set membership.\nLike stems, flagsets are usually short. If we measure a histogram of the number of flags used per stem in all dictionaries in LibreOffice/dictionaries, we see the distribution skew very short:\nNumber of flagsPercentile (rounded)\n032\n169\n280\n386\n490\n......\n796\n......\n\nOne crazy dictionary used 271 flags on a single stem.\nSo if we can store some number of flags inline like we did with bytes an Umbra string, we can avoid allocations in the vast majority of cases.\nRather than an \"Umbra string\" we'll be constructing a more generic \"Umbra slice\" type. In fact we can imagine that the UmbraString is just a special case of an UmbraSlice around bytes:\n\nThe new type comes with new challenges though. For... reasons... Flag is defined as:\n\nSo rather than dealing with bytes we need to deal with 16-bit integers. Ok, that changes the arithmetic a little:\n\nWe can fit up to 7 flags inline. That's really awesome: it'll cover up to 96% of real-world flagsets and should save us many many really tiny allocations.\nPitfalls and MaybeUninit&lt;T&gt;\nWe're talking in terms of u16 above but our type is actually a NonZeroU16. They have the same size and layout but NonZeroU16 can't be 0u16. The challenge is the NonZero nature: the zeroed bit pattern is not a valid representation, and Default for NonZeroU16 is not a thing. Places where we wrote [0u8; N] above have to be rewritten anyways since we're changing the type, but we can't just say:\n\nYou can't say that a value is a NonZeroU16 and at the same time represent it with zeroes, even if you never formally access those elements of the array. The proper way to encode what we're trying to do is to use MaybeUninit.\n\nThis makes the type slightly harder to work with: when accessing the prefix and suffix arrays we need to be sure to ptr::cast() from a pointer of MaybeUninit&lt;T&gt; to a pointer of T. When initializing the slice in our From implementation we need to transmute the source slice from &amp;[T] to &amp;[MaybeUninit&lt;T&gt;] before we can copy the data:\n\nZeroed bit patterns\nWe also need to be very careful to initialize prefix and suffix with MaybeUninit&lt;T&gt;::zeroed() rather than MaybeUninit&lt;T&gt;::uninit(). Why? Remember that our PartialEq&lt;Self&gt; implementation compares the prefix array and maybe also the suffix array for the short variant. Those arrays might contain uninitialized data if the length of the slice is shorter than the INLINE_LEN or PREFIX_LEN. MaybeUninit&lt;T&gt;::zeroed() works around this because comparing zeroed bits is defined behavior. The important distinction is that we are not treating the zeroed memory as NonZeroU16. That is undefined behavior. If we treat it as a usize though, the zeroed bit pattern is valid and the behavior is defined. It's also accurate as long as T is Copy.\n\nNull pointer optimization and strange behavior\nWhat exactly can go wrong if you don't use MaybeUninit&lt;T&gt;? The compiler can see that NonZeroU16 cannot ever be a zeroed bit pattern and it can design the layouts for other types using FlagSlice around that. If we designed our type like this:\n\nThen FlagSlice is eligible for the null pointer memory layout optimization. The compiler can tell that the zero bit pattern is not a valid representation for the struct and so it can try to fit other information in that representation, like whether an Option&lt;T&gt; is Some or None. It's a really handy optimization that makes size_of::&lt;Option&lt;T&gt;&gt;() == size_of::&lt;T&gt;() - you don't pay for the option. But how would you represent the empty flag slice?\n\nThe length is zero, the prefix is zeroes, the suffix is zeroes. The whole struct is zeroes! With this representation, Option::&lt;FlagSlice&gt;::None is exactly the same as FlagSlice::default(), causing your code to behave weirdly. Suddenly Some(FlagSlice::default()).is_some() is false! 🥴\nWhile this pitfall seems scary and hard to debug, Miri has got your back. Write types without the MaybeUninit&lt;T&gt; wrapper and cargo miri test will helpfully point out that you're opening yourself up to undefined behavior.\nFlagSlice Memory Savings\nRerunning the same example from above, DHAT reports:\n\nSo to compare:\nStem + FlagSetTotalAt t-gmaxReads (B)Writes (B)\nBox&lt;str&gt; + Box&lt;[Flag]&gt;3,086,190 bytes in 130,988 blocks2,717,005 bytes in 90,410 blocks3,923,4752,610,900\nUmbraString + Box&lt;[Flag]&gt;2,714,546 bytes in 82,475 blocks2,343,567 bytes in 41,487 blocks2,332,5872,239,256\nUmbraString + FlagSlice2,584,850 bytes in 44,741 blocks2,190,833 bytes in 947 blocks1,733,3612,109,560\n\nThese are some respectable savings! We've cut out about a half of a megabyte of total memory, used far fewer allocations (blocks) and write to the heap a fair amount less. Plus we read from the heap less than half as much as we did before the changes.\nNot every dictionary will see the same savings, though: some dictionaries use more flags and have longer stems. But as discussed above, every time we use a short variant of an Umbra slice we save memory over a Box&lt;str&gt; or Box&lt;[Flag]&gt;.\nWrapping up &amp; Kudos\nWe've designed and implemented a German string inspired UmbraSlice&lt;T&gt; type that can carry a small number of Ts inline - a small slice optimization - and used it to save a respectable amount of total memory for the Dictionary type, and also cut way down on heap interaction. We've also stumbled upon lots of interesting detours into Rust topics: fat pointers, runtime memory measurement, MaybeUninit&lt;T&gt; and the null-pointer optimization. The full code for UmbraSlice&lt;T&gt; lives in Spellbook's repository in src/umbra_slice.rs.\nAs mentioned above, CedarDB has an excellent intro post for German strings and also a nice deeper dive. The former has a snide remark about an optimization which is supposedly impossible in Rust, provoking interesting response posts by those who had been successfully nerd-sniped. One of these - An Optimization That's Impossible in Rust! - I found very informative on the Rust aspects of implementing German strings, and may be interesting if your use-case benefits from Clone for UmbraString being cheap like Clone for Arc. (Not so for Spellbook.) Thank you to these authors!\n","id":"https://the-mikedavis.github.io/posts/german-string-optimizations-in-spellbook/","title":"\"German string\" optimizations in Spellbook"},"https://the-mikedavis.github.io/posts/ktls-sendfile-s3/":{"body":"This post covers uploading a file to S3. It's pretty simple: make an HTTP/1.1 PUT request and now your file is in the cloud 🪄.\nWhat could possibly be interesting about something so mundane? Well, we're going to leverage the Linux kernel to do it in an unnecessarily efficient way. (Note: I think FreeBSD also supports this but I haven't tried it.)\nWe'll be looking at a novel way - used by no existing AWS SDK clients to my knowledge - to upload to S3.\nHow you'd normally do it\nAWS S3 has a REST HTTP API which accepts HTTP/1.1. You can add an \"object\" (basically a file) to the \"bucket\" (kinda like a file system) with a PutObject request.\nHTTP/1.1 is super simple. To quote RFC 7230, the syntax looks like so:\n\nFor example inserting an object could look like this (quoting the AWS documentation):\n\nThe start-line is the HTTP method, path, and \"HTTP/1.1\" all separated by spaces. Then you have a set of headers. Then an empty line and then the body. All of these lines use the CRLF line-ending (\\r\\n). Open a TLS socket to this S3 endpoint and send that binary data (after TLS encryption) and you can upload to S3.\n\nA quick aside: calculating the authorization header is a little bit involved. I will totally skip over it in this post. The proper docs are here and a simple Erlang implementation is included in the gist linked later.\n\nIn Erlang this might look like so:\n\nErlang has an odd Prolog-like syntax but hopefully you get the gist. We open a connection to S3 and send an HTTP/1.1 PUT request with the file's contents as the HTTP/1.1 body.\nThis is nice and straightforward but it means that we need to read the entire file contents into memory in order to upload the file. We could read in smaller chunks or use a chunked transfer-encoding or even a fancy multi-part upload. No matter how we slice it though, we need to read the file into our Erlang program's memory.\nOr do we?!\nsendfile(2)\nsendfile(2) is a system call which a \"userspace\" program (a program above the kernel) can use to instruct the kernel to copy the contents of one file descriptor to another. You can use sendfile against a TCP socket to instruct the kernel to write a file's contents to a network connection. The advantage of this is that you don't ever need to read the file contents into a buffer in the Erlang program's memory. It's all up to the kernel to move those bytes around. Especially since Erlang is a garbage-collected language, a program can save some memory and work by using sendfile instead of reading and writing to a socket itself.\n\nThe rub is that sendfile(2) is a naive way to transfer bytes. It doesn't know about TLS encryption. Bytes are ferried from one file descriptor to the other (maybe a socket) as-is.\nkTLS\nEnter kTLS: kernel TLS. After performing a TLS handshake in userspace (your program) you can offload the work of doing TLS encryption and decryption to the kernel by setting options on the socket with the connection's current TLS parameters. This makes things simpler in your userspace program: you don't need to encrypt anything, just send plain text on the socket. The kernel then transparently takes care of everything.\nThe really special thing about kTLS, for our purposes, is that it lets us treat a TLS encrypted network connection like a regular old unencrypted socket.\nkTLS + sendfile(2) uploads\nThe gist of the code using kTLS in Erlang would be:\n\nI'm glossing over the details of the kTLS handover here intentionally. It's not well supported by Erlang yet and I even needed to patch Erlang to support the cipher currently negotiated by the S3 servers. For a full example see this gist.\nIs it faster?\nNo! Actually I see the userspace and kernel versions of these uploads taking a very similar amount of time on the same size file (around 500 MiB). The optimization of sendfile(2) is not speed so much as memory. We avoid reading the file at all and instead let the kernel do it. So we need fancier system-wide benchmarks rather than a simple \"upload time.\" In fact we can't even realize the full gains of this method without specialized hardware. (More below...)\nBut to quote Joe Armstrong in Erlang and OTP in Action:\n\nMake it work, then make it beautiful, then if you really, really have to, make it fast. 90 percent of the time, if you make it beautiful, it will already be fast. So really, just make it beautiful!\n\nWe've completely avoided TLS encryption and file reads in the userspace, and I think that's beautiful. I'm sure it's also performant in a loaded system, but I'll need to revisit this post with numbers when I can actually measure it.\nIn the meantime, we can talk about making it more beautiful.\nHardware offload\nThe Linux kernel docs discuss a really juicy optimization: zero-copy sendfile.\nWhen kTLS is enabled, the encryption does not necessarily need to be done by the kernel itself. Instead, the kernel might pawn off job of encrypting data to the Network Interface Controller (NIC, also known as \"network card\"), if the NIC has the hardware-level support for doing the encryption itself. This means that instead of the encryption being done by your CPU on your RAM, the NIC takes care of everything. This lets the kernel treat the call to sendfile(2) as if it were a sendfile(2) call against a regular, unencrypted TCP socket. The kernel can send the bytes without any extra buffering for encryption.\nThe are some limitations to this approach: namely that the file can't be modified between the beginning and end of sendfile(2). For cases where files are immutable once closed, though, as they might be when you upload them to S3, this is perfectly fine.\nWrapping up\nThis was a quick look at using kTLS and sendfile(2) to upload files to S3 as efficiently as theoretically possible. I hope to revisit this post later with numbers and graphs showing how this impacts an actual system.\nIn the meantime here are a bunch of links for further reading:\n\nhttps://erlangforums.com/t/introduce-kernel-tls-in-ssl-application/952\nhttps://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/6104\nhttps://delthas.fr/blog/2023/kernel-tls/\nhttps://netdevconf.org/1.2/papers/ktls.pdf\nhttps://netdevconf.info//0x14/pub/slides/25/TLS%20Perf%20Characterization%20slides%20-%20Netdev%200x14%20v2.pdf\n\n","id":"https://the-mikedavis.github.io/posts/ktls-sendfile-s3/","title":"Uploading a file to S3 without reading it"},"https://the-mikedavis.github.io/posts/sparse-array-dst/":{"body":"Dynamically sized types (DSTs) are one of a few exotically sized Rust types. Rust and its standard library have good tools for creating regular sized types but creating dynamically sized types can be a pain.\nWe'll jump through DSTs quickly and look at an application - sparse arrays - to see how tricky DSTs are today.\nWhile creating a DST I was surprised at the lack of resources on DST creation and use. This post is meant as a reference for anyone retracing my steps, or as an informative look into a trickier part of data structure implementation in Rust.\nThis post is meant for those interested in data structure design in Rust and, to get the most out of this post, you should already be familiar with the concept of a DST. Otherwise this post may be a bit in-the-weeds - but hopefully still valuable.\nDynamically sized types\nDSTs are special because the compiler doesn't know how large they are at runtime. Take a regular sized type:\n\nThe compiler knows the size of this type. It's the sum of it's fields, 3 bytes.\nWhat about [u8] though, how many bytes are in that? If it's not a constant-sized array like [u8; 3] then you don't know at compile-time.\nDSTs in the wild\nThe two common types of DSTs you may have seen are str and [T]. In fact str is just [u8] that's guaranteed to be UTF-8 so let's just say [T].\nUnlike [T; 5], [T] has an unknown number of Ts. In practice you've probably seen this type borrowed: &amp;[T]. There are also owned versions: Box&lt;[T]&gt;, Rc&lt;[T]&gt;, Arc&lt;[T]&gt; and similar.\nThe borrowed version is intuitive: you have a reference to some consecutive elements in an array allocation. A &amp;[T] is a slice of some number of elements of a Vec&lt;T&gt; (or similar array allocation). And a &amp;str is a slice of some valid UTF-8 bytes of a String (String is just a Vec&lt;u8&gt; that is valid UTF-8).\nThe owned ones are not much different. They're really just owned: the data is on the heap and the type represents a pointer to it which has ownership of the allocated data. The trick, though, is that these types are wider than usual:\n\nIf it were just a pointer it would be the same size as a usize: a machine word, the size of a pointer by definition. Instead Box&lt;[T]&gt; and friends take two words to represent. One word is the pointer to the data and the other is the length of the slice.\nAn application: sparse arrays\nI'll be talking about sparse arrays as they are used in the use-case I'm interested in: Hash Array Mapped Tries. In this context, a sparse array is an array - a contiguous sequence of values - where you expect a \"sparse\" number (i.e. few) entries to actually be used. The rest of the slots are left uninitialized or as defaults.\nIf you're familiar with MaybeUninit&lt;T&gt;, a sparse array is conceptually like [MaybeUninit&lt;T&gt;; N]. The upside of sparse arrays is that you don't pay the cost of representing uninitialized slots.\nSay you have a [T; 64] - 64 Ts, stored contiguously in memory. If only some of these are initialized or meaningful then you waste a lot of space representing the entire array. Only utilizing some small N indices of this array leaves 64 - N slots wasted. When you have very many of these arrays or when size_of::&lt;T&gt;() is large, wasted T allocations can add up.\nSparse arrays cut down on this wasted space by only allocating enough space to store occupied slots. Then a header is used to determine which indexes into the array are occupied by which slots. For Hash Array Mapped Tries, the layout looks like this:\n\nAt the beginning of this type, a 64-bit bitmap describes which entries are set in the dynamically sized array, and which indexes into the SparseArray correspond to which index in entries. With this layout, setting index 5 to 100 and 10 to 200 means that the 5th and 10th bit of the bitmap are set and the entries array is allocated with 100 and then 200.\nYou can imagine an empty sparse array as just the bitmap:\n\nAnd then a sparse array with elements at index 0 and 3 could be:\n\nThis use-case fits a dynamically sized type well: the true size of the type depends on its value at runtime. The number of bits set in the bitmap is the number of entries in entries.\nThis takes a fixed size of overhead for every sparse array, but you don't pay for allocating uninitialized or meaningless entries.\nThis post skips over the implications of inserting or deleting an element (resizing the sparse array) and other interesting features. I will cover Hash Array Mapped Tries in part two of this post. Instead here we'll talk about how implementing this type - and using it - is a pain, and how we can make our lives easier by just giving up and dealing with pointers.\nFighting for a DST - a fool's errand\nMy first implementation of this type looked just like the above SparseArray&lt;T&gt;:\n\nNote that entries: [T] is what makes it a DST and will bring us much pain. (As a peculiarity of custom DSTs, it must be the last field which is a DST. A DST anywhere else is an error.) The compiler can see from [T] that we're dealing with an \"unsized\" type (?Sized) and will let us know in future error messages.\nWe'll start with making an empty SparseArray.\n\nBut already we run into trouble:\n\nThe gist is that we can't return SparseArray&lt;T&gt; from any function. This is the same for familiar DSTs too: you can't have a variable bound to some [T]. Instead you always work in terms of &amp;[T] or Box&lt;[T]&gt; (or similar owned wrapper).\n\n\nA consequence of being unable to return Self is that we can't implement useful traits like Clone and Default. So already we are drifting away from the the nice tools available for sized types.\nThe solution here? Return an owned type wrapping SparseArray. Like mentioned above we can use a Box&lt;Self&gt;, Rc&lt;Self&gt;, Arc&lt;Self&gt; or anything similar. I'll use Box&lt;Self&gt; here for simplicity, though eventually I want an Arc to make this data structure persistent and thread-safe.\n\nReaching into pointer and allocation stuff from std::alloc and std::ptr may look a little ham-fisted but it's not necessarily unusual for data structure implementations. The part of this that was unfamiliar to me was std::ptr::slice_from_raw_parts_mut. This is one of the standard library's few utilities for working with dynamically sized types. The important part about this function is that it forms a possibly wide pointer based on the metadata (second argument). A wide pointer describes the pointer itself along with some metadata like the number of elements in a [T].\nSo with empty or new, Box&lt;SparseArray&lt;T&gt;&gt; actually ends up as size_of::&lt;usize&gt;() * 2. One word holds the pointer to the DST and another holds the length of entries. Unfortunately this is using extra space to encode data that we already know. The number of entries can be computed from the bitmap by counting the number of 1 bits, either through CPU-specific instructions, a series of shifts or SIMD.\nAlready I don't like adding unnecessary data just to track the DST. And as mentioned above, we're fighting common traits. If we try to reimplement Clone:\n\nThis doesn't look very much like a regular impl Clone for T. And to call it we need to use SparseArray::clone(&amp;my_sparse_array) :/. We've left familiar Rust ergonomics!\nThe workaround: pointers\nWe're straying from the niceties of sized types and that leaves us doing un-ergonomic stuff. Can we make things simpler for ourselves, and maybe avoid that extra wide-pointer overhead, please?\nThe type\nentries: [T] is a problem because it's a DST. Let's replace it with a sized type... [T; 0].\n\nNow SparseArray&lt;T&gt; is a pointer to some allocated type and we've chosen to hide the actual size of SparseArrayInner from the compiler. The tradeoff is that we are now responsible for allocating the data and accessing it appropriately. And now SparseArray&lt;T&gt; is a sized type: NonNull&lt;T&gt; is a pointer and we know the size of a pointer statically.\nAccessing the bitmap and entries\nIf the SparseArray&lt;T&gt; type is a pointer to the inner type, we can read that pointer to get the Bitmap and &amp;[T].\n\nIn SparseArray::entries we cast the pointer to the entries, *const [T; 0], to be a *const T. This lets us create a slice from it. The safety docs for slice::from_raw_parts say that the pointer must be valid for a read of len Ts. As long as we allocate and initialize those entries then we're good to go.\nAllocating the sparse array\nLet's rewrite SparseArray::new from above to allocate the memory, but then cast it as a SparseArrayInner&lt;T&gt; rather than deal with ptr::slice_from_raw_parts_mut.\n\nWe allocate for enough Ts according to the Bitmap::len. Then, like above, we cast the pointer to the entries, *mut [T; 0], to *mut T and then perform the writing of contiguous entries ourselves.\nDefault\nNow that SparseArray&lt;T&gt; is a sized type, we can create them ergonomically with familiar traits like Default. This replaces our prior SparseArray::empty function.\n\nThat's more like it! Very straightforward.\nClone\nWhile we're at it, implementing Clone is straightforward too: copy the bitmap and clone all of the entries.\n\nAs mentioned above I want to use this type in a Hash Array Mapped Trie and I want to put the pointer behind an Arc. Clone is a really useful standard trait to implement for this use-case since it will allow us to use the awesome standard library function Arc::make_mut which makes concurrent persistent data structures easy to implement.\nDrop\nThe really important trait to implement is Drop. Since we've taken over the allocation of this type, the compiler will no longer help us drop it correctly.\n\nWhen dropping a SparseArray&lt;T&gt; we first drop the entries, if they need to be dropped, and then deallocate the chunk of memory.\nWrapping up\nWith the new definition of SparseArray&lt;T&gt; we have a sized type which can implement common traits like Default and Clone. While the actual allocated chunk of memory has a variable size, the size of a SparseArray&lt;T&gt; is constant and thin - only the size of a pointer. Now we don't waste an extra usize of memory on tracking the entries length twice.\n\nWhile custom sized types are well supported by the standard library, dynamically sized types (DSTs) can be annoying to create and work with. An escape hatch for this is to put the type behind a pointer yourself. This places more responsibility on you, but it gives you full control over the type's representation.\n","id":"https://the-mikedavis.github.io/posts/sparse-array-dst/","title":"Sparse arrays in Rust and creating custom DSTs"}},"docInfo":{"https://the-mikedavis.github.io/":{"body":16,"title":0},"https://the-mikedavis.github.io/posts/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://the-mikedavis.github.io/posts/german-string-optimizations-in-spellbook/":{"body":2037,"title":4},"https://the-mikedavis.github.io/posts/ktls-sendfile-s3/":{"body":587,"title":5},"https://the-mikedavis.github.io/posts/sparse-array-dst/":{"body":979,"title":6}},"length":5},"lang":"English"}
